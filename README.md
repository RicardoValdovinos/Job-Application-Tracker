# Job Application Tracker

## Description

While applying for jobs I came to realize that having a tool to monitor the progress of my applications might be something useful to have. 
I could have just used some kind of spreadsheet software like Excel or Google Sheets but where's the fun in that?

The UI is quite simple and gives you the option to add jobs and edit them (after making a selction). To delete a job, you simply select a job, click edit, and then delete.

As time goes on I will be adding more features as necessary.
